# desk-bling-slackbot
A Slackbot/Particle Photon app to bling out the boss's desk with Slack-controllable RGB LED strips

#  What is this?
I was bored, the boss was out, and had some extra components lying around. I grabbed a [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/#photon), some spare [RGB LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DTOAWZ2/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and some [N-Channel MOSFETs](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/infineon-technologies/IRLB8721PBF/IRLB8721PBF-ND/2127670). I attached it all underneath the boss's desk to create some mood lighting.

The plan is for the desk lights to be controlled via the Photon in Slack.

# The circuit
Coming soon. Also make sure I add the note about the likely problem I introduced with that voltage regulator, etc etc.
